# Chapter 3. Genetic Drift: The Power of Chance

In the previous chapter, we have established that under Hardy-Weinberg assumptions - infinite population size, random mating, no mutation or selection, etc. - nothing ever changes. Allele frequencies stay the same forever, and if the genotype frequencies are not currently at Hardy- Weinberg frequencies, they will get there in a single generation, and then remain there forever.

It’s now time to relax some if these assumptions. The first assumption that we are going to relax is that of the infinite population size. We are now going to assume that populations are finite. It turns out that this has enormous effects for evolution. When populations are finite, chance effects will start to play a role. These chance effects are stronger when populations are smaller. 

A word of warning - this is an intense chapter, but it's also a lot of fun! Don't worry if this takes a little longer than the other chapters, I fully expect that to be the case. This is also the longest chapter in the book. But learners have always found this to be one of the most rewarding chapters. Here are some of the things you'll learn:

* Finite population size introduces randomness into evolutionary dynamics (genetic drift)
* Genetic drift acts to reduce genetic variation.
* The effect of drift is proportional to the population size: the smaller the population, the larger the effect of drift.
* Unless other forces counter it, genetic drift will reduce all genetic variation in every population.
* Drift is a slow process - it takes about 1.4N generations to reduce the genetic variation of a population by half.
* The effective population size is a key concept - it is the size of an ideal (Wright-Fisher) population that shows the same decay of genetic variation as the actual population of interest.
* The effective population size is often smaller than the actual population size, due to various reasons such as population size bottlenecks, or unequal sex ratios.
* We’ll also cover some key programming concepts such as arrays and conditional flows.
