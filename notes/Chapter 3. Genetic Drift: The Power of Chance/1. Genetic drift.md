# Genetic drift: Intro

Now we are changing the rules of the previus Chapter. 
Now we are working with **Finite population size**.

![finite](../assets/finite.png "finite")

Population size is typically denoted
with this capital "**N**" letter.

Now a finite population size can mean many things.
We can talk about only tens of individuals,
or perhaps hundreds of individuals,
but we can also talk about a very, very large population size,
even billions of individuals,
or sometimes even trillions of individuals.

If you think about, for example, single-celled organisms,
bacteria, for example,
these can often be--
the population sizes of these species can often be very, very large.

With finite population sizes,
there are **chance effects**,
and this is the key effect of this chapter
and the principal cause of **genetic drift**.

**Chance effects** will be stronger in smaller populations.

*For example:*

> 50% means that if you flip 10 times a coin 5 times was head and 5 times was tail? 
No... Maybe is 4:6, 3:7, 6:4... etc **It's not always the same result**!
It's random! 0:10 and 10:0 are also possible...

We can calculate how often are each of these scenarios with 
the **binomial distribution**.
