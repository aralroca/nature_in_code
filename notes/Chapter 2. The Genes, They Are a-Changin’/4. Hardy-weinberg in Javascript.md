# Hardy-weinberg in JavaScript

*Important notes:*

```
f(A1) -> p = 1 - q 
f(A2) -> q = 1 - p

f(A1A1) = p x p = p^2
f(A1A2) = (p x q) + (q x p) = 2pq
f(A2A2) = q x q = q^2

p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
```

Now we are going to implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
const a1a1 = 0.15;
const a2a2 = 0.35;
const a1a2 = 1 - (a1a1 + a2a2);

const p = a1a1 + (a1a2 / 2);
const q = 1 - p;
```
